# PoPoolation2

PoPoolation2 ([Kofler *et al.*, 2011](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/27/24/3435/306737)) allows to compare allele frequencies for SNPs between two or more populations and to identify significant differences. PoPoolation2 requires next generation sequencing data of pooled genomic DNA (Pool-Seq). It may be used for measuring differentiation between populations, for genome wide association studies and for experimental evolution.

# Repository

This repository is a fork of [PoPoolation2](https://sourceforge.net/projects/popoolation2/) from SourceForge to GitHub. The original code was developed by [Robert Kofler](https://www.vetmeduni.ac.at/en/population-genetics/research/research-groups/kofler-lab/group-leader/) and ported here with his explicit permission under the [BSD 2-Clause "Simplified" License](https://github.com/lczech/popoolation2/blob/master/LICENSE.md).

# Usage

At the moment, we here purely cloned the repository, without any modifications to its content. The [Wiki](https://github.com/lczech/popoolation2/wiki) contains the tutorials as well, but was not yet adapted from the SourceForge-based `svn` commands to the GitHub-based `git` commands.
